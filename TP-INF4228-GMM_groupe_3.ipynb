    ">L'algorithme Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) est un algorithme d'apprentissage non supervisé. Le GMM est classé dans les algorithmes de clustering, car il peut être utilisé pour trouver des clusters dans les données. Les concepts clés dont vous devriez avoir entendu parler sont :\n",
    " - Distribution gaussienne multivariée\n",
    " - Matrice de covariance\n",
    " - Vecteur moyen de données multivariées\n",
    "\n",
    " **Nous voulons utiliser des modèles de mélange gaussien pour trouver des clusters dans un ensemble de données à partir duquel nous connaissons (ou supposons connaître) le nombre de clusters contenus dans cet ensemble de données, mais nous ne savons pas où se trouvent ces clusters ni comment ils sont façonnés.** Trouver ces clusters est la tâche du GMM. Nous essayons de **trouver un certain nombre de distributions gaussiennes** qui peuvent être utilisées pour décrire la forme de notre ensemble de données.\n",
    " > ### 2. **PRINCIPE** \n",
    " >> Comme son nom l'indique, un **modèle de mélange gaussien implique le mélange** (c'est-à-dire la superposition) de plusieurs distributions gaussiennes. Ici, plutôt que d'identifier les clusters par les centroïdes \"les plus proches\", nous ajustons un ensemble de k gaussiennes aux données. Et nous estimons les paramètres de distribution gaussienne tels que la moyenne et la variance pour chaque cluster et le poids d'un cluster. Après avoir appris les paramètres de chaque point de données, nous pouvons calculer les probabilités qu'il appartienne à chacun des clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    " > ### 2. **Pourquoi GMM**\n",
    " >> Si nous avons des données où nous supposons que les clusters ne sont pas définis par de simples cercles mais par des formes ellipsoïdes plus complexes, nous préférons l'approche GMM à l'approche KNN.\n",
    " >>De même que K-mean les GMM peuvent être utilisé pour classer les données : Quoi qu'il y ait plusieurs avantages à utilisé GMM\n",
    " >>> * k-means ne tient pas compte de la variance(qui définissent la forme de la distribution)\n",
    " >>> * K-mean place un cercle au centre de chaque cluster ( Inadéquat si les données ne sont pas circulaires )\n",
    " >>> * GMM prend en compte plusieurs formes de modèle\n",
    " >>> * **K-mean fait une classification deterministe où GMM est plutôt soft**\n",
    " >>>> *In Sklearn,gmm.predict(X) the model assigns every data point to one of the clusters and  gmm.predict_proba(X) function return the* probabilities that a data point belongs to each of the K clusters*\n",
